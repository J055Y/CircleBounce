# CircleBounce

Canvas animation of circles in JavaScript. Each circle bounces off of the canvas bounds and lines with varying opacity are drawn between neighbouring circles within a given distance. Circles within a given distance of the mouse will follow the mouse until they break off when the mouse moves too fast.
